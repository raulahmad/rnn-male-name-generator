# Text Generation with RNN
This repository holds a small Text Generation notebook, featuring Recurrent Neural Networks, build for academical purposes. It is a **Male Name Generator**, created for the sake of illustrating and documenting how RNN work. For this very reason we have chosen a Jupyter Notebook instead of an ordinary Python script to develop the code. 

The RNN is build using **Tensorflow 2** , in particular, using the **Keras** submodule.
